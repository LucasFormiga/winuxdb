# Product Guidelines: WinuxDB\n\n## Design Principles\n- **Modern & Unique**: Avoid the standard Shadcn "look and feel." Customize components (colors, borders, shadows, typography) to create a distinct identity.\n- **Visual Feedback**: Every interaction (click, hover, focus) should provide immediate, high-quality feedback.\n- **Visual Hierarchy**: Use typography and spacing to clearly differentiate between primary and secondary information.\n- **Responsive**: All interfaces must be fully functional and aesthetically pleasing on mobile devices first, then scales to larger screens.\n\n## User Experience (UX)\n- **Fast Discovery**: Search and filtering should be instantaneous and intuitive.\n- **Accessibility (a11y)**: Aim for WCAG 2.1 Level AA compliance. Ensure proper contrast, keyboard navigation, and screen reader support.\n- **Performance**: Minimize initial load times and optimize data fetching for a snappy experience.\n\n## Content & Tone\n- **Multilingual Excellence**: All content must be accurately translated for English, Portuguese, and Spanish. Default to English.\n- **Clarity over Cleverness**: Use clear, concise language. Technical terms should be explained if not commonly known.\n- **Community-focused**: The tone should be welcoming, transparent, and encourage contributions.\n\n## Visual Assets\n- **Logo/Screenshot Area**: Ensure placeholders or actual images are consistently sized and optimized for different screen resolutions.\n- **Medal Representation**: Each compatibility rating (BORKED, BRONZE, SILVER, GOLD, PLATINUM, NATIVE) should have a distinct, universally recognizable color and icon.
