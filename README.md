# 🍷 WinuxDB

WinuxDB is the definitive community-driven compatibility index for Windows applications on Linux. Inspired by projects like ProtonDB, we aim to eliminate "compatibility anxiety" by providing clear, community-verified data on how productivity, creative, and utility apps behave under Wine and Proton.
